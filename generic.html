              The purpose of this project was to integrate Price Digest into my company's website,
              which is Pawee Leasing Corporation. 
              This was done by writing code in C# in order to do the API calls. In this project, I 
              established a database connection, creating error logging, and would pull the data 
              from the API calls and store them into our SQL Server tables. From there, I'd take 
              the data and create numerous stored procedures that were being used in order to insert, 
              update, and select the data for display.

              This is a project that contains numerous topics I had the opportunity to focus on in 
              learning how to write code in C#. I learned the most of what I could in about 2 weeks,
              as my boss needed a Developer who was willing to learn this language in order to integrate 
              the Price Digest API with our systems. Since I'm someone who strives for learning and growing,
              I decided to volunteer to take on this difficult, yet exciting new task. So in those 2 weeks, 
              when I wasn't at work, this is what I was learning. I'm proud of what I accomplished in that 
              time, and I'm grateful for the new knowledge I've obtained and can now apply to my every-day 
              life as a Developer.

              This is a small personal project I decided to do to practice my Python a bit. I was able to develop a 
              chatroom where people would be able to do simply that, chat with each other! It allowed for each 
              person that connected to the server to be able to enter the name they wanted to go by, or their 
              "nickname". This was developed using a local default IP address and host, which allows for the 
              chat room to only operate on a local computer. This was my first project I did in Python on my own,
              and I was really happy with the outcome.

              This is an application I created using Python in order to do simple temperature conversion 
              with inputs. I did Celsius to Fahrenheit, as well as Fahrenheit to Celsius. This is a project
              I tried out when I was first learning how to write code in Python. While it is a basic project,
              I still like to look back on where I started vs. where I am now. It really helps me see just 
              how far I've come as a developer and how much I've grown.

              This is a Python application I designed while taking a Udemy Course online. This is a guessing 
              game that's designed for the user to enter a random number between 1-1000. Whenever a number is 
              entered, it will display for the user to guess higher, lower, or if they guessed the number 
              correctly. The user also has the option to exit the code by typing 0. Otherwise, the code will 
              continue to loop. This was a fun little project I learned in my Python Mastery course I took in 
              Udemy. I really enjoyed building a game like this for the first time!

              This was a team project where we developed a website where customers could order pizza, drinks, and 
              sides. The orders were sent to the shop and delivery was not available with this design. We used the 
              Django Framework and used Python as our primary language. This project also included using
              HTML/CSS/JavaScript. This was my first ever team proejct I built in school. It was also the first 
              time I had the opportunity to practice using an Agile Methodology. We used a backlog for all of our
              tasks that were needing to completed. We'd then meet each week and divide one task up between each
              of us (there were 4 of us working on this project). My main job on this project was building the
              payment page, where I used Sandbox in order to allow for fake payments to be accepted.
