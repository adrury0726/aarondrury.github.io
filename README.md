# aarondrury.github.io

This is my own personal website I created in order to showcase a little bit of my HTML/CSS/JavaScript abilities. While this only showcases a small portion of what I know how to do, as well as what I've done as a 
developer, I did this for fun and thought it'd make a great addition to my resume. While work history is great to have, I also like to show that I do more development outside of my 8-5 days, as this is 
what I'm passionate about and enjoy doing.

The main purpose of this website it to go a little more in depth about who I am both as an individual and a developer, so that you can get to know me better. I hope you enjoy it!
